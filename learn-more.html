          <h2>Our story</h2>
          <p>Abundant Love Kids Foundation (ALKIF) is a Ghanaian, community-rooted organization dedicated to restoring hope for vulnerable children and strengthening families through practical, compassionate action. We believe every child deserves safety, education, health care, and the emotional support needed to grow with dignity. Our work centers on protection, learning, wellness, and community resilience, delivered through programs shaped by local voices.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="learn-section">
          <h2>Our inspiration</h2>
          <p>ALKIF was born from the simple but urgent belief that love, when organized, can change a child's future. We are inspired by the resilience of children who keep showing up despite hardship, and by caregivers and community leaders who refuse to give up on their neighborhoods. We are also driven by the conviction that lasting change must be locally led, transparent, and consistent. Each program is designed with communities, not just for them.</p>
